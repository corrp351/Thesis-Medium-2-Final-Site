			Our brains are some of the most complex, beautiful, and impressive miracles of nature. We are able to laugh, love, cry, and create because of them. But we live in a world where it can be easy to forget to use this special tool. More and more we are seeing technology, especially, taking over tasks that we deem menial. But at what cost? These small things being taken on by robots and computers may be helpful to some extent, but we are losing ourselves somewhat in the process. When was the last time you looked around you, truly looked, and saw the little beauties, the hidden treasures? When was the last time you were able to look at something and imagine all the possiblities of what it could turn into, what it could become? This is a super power, being able to imagine and create, and one that a lot of people have lost or forgotten as they've grown older and more entrenched in the increasingly automated world. But there are ways to inspire at least some sparks of creativity again. Science tells us that we can actually practice being creative, we can evoke creativity (even if it feels uncomfortable sometimes), we can learn how to be a child again.
